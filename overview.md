# Poly Factory — Mod Overview

> A small Mekanism-inspired processing mod for Minecraft 26.1.2 (NeoForge). Pipe an item in,
> let the machine process it using stored FE, pipe the result out.

---

## Vision

One block, one job: the **Fabricator** takes an item in its input slot, consumes FE energy over
time to process it according to a data-driven recipe, and places the result in its output slot.
Pipe mods (a separate mod the user already has) connect to the input/output via the standard
NeoForge item-transfer capability, and to the energy buffer via the standard FE capability.

---

## Core Block

| Block / Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Fabricator** | Directional processing machine. Right-click opens a GUI with input/output slots, a progress arrow, and an FE energy bar. Lights up (`active=true` blockstate) while processing. |

There are no cables/pipes/networking in this mod — that's intentionally left to whichever pipe
mod the user pairs this with. The Fabricator just exposes standard capabilities on all 6 sides.

## Technical Architecture

```
[ Pipe mod ] --item--> [ input slot ] --(FabricatingRecipe, draining FE/tick)--> [ output slot ] --item--> [ Pipe mod ]
[ Power mod ] --FE-----------------> [ internal energy buffer ]
```

- **FabricatorBlock** — directional (`facing`) + `active` blockstate, `EntityBlock` with a server-side ticker.
- **FabricatorBlockEntity** — owns a 2-slot `FabricatorItemHandler` (input/output, via NeoForge's
  modern `ResourceHandler<ItemResource>` transfer API) and a `SimpleEnergyHandler` (FE buffer).
  Each server tick it looks up a matching `FabricatingRecipe` via `RecipeManager.CachedCheck`,
  drains `energy_per_tick` FE while processing, and after `processing_time` ticks moves the
  result into the output slot.
- **ModCapabilities** — registers `Capabilities.Item.BLOCK` and `Capabilities.Energy.BLOCK` for
  the block entity so any pipe/cable mod can insert into the input slot, extract from the output
  slot, and push FE into the buffer from any side.
- **FabricatingRecipe** — a `SingleItemRecipe` subclass (ingredient -> `ItemStackTemplate` result,
  plus `processing_time` ticks and `energy_per_tick` FE) loaded from datapack JSON under
  `data/polyfactory/recipe/`, type `polyfactory:fabricating`.
- **FabricatorMenu / FabricatorScreen** — GUI built on vanilla `ContainerData` (no custom
  networking needed); the screen is rendered programmatically (filled rectangles) since no GUI
  texture atlas is provided.

## Adding more recipes

Drop a JSON file in `src/main/resources/data/polyfactory/recipe/`:

```json
{
  "type": "polyfactory:fabricating",
  "ingredient": "minecraft:raw_iron",
  "result": { "id": "minecraft:iron_ingot", "count": 1 },
  "processing_time": 100,
  "energy_per_tick": 20
}
```

## Possible future extensions

- [ ] Multiple machine tiers (faster processing / bigger energy buffer).
- [ ] Multi-input or multi-output recipes (would require moving off `SingleItemRecipe`).
- [x] JEI recipe display integration (see `net.umf.polyfactory.jei`).
- [ ] Per-side I/O configuration (currently any side can insert/extract/charge).
